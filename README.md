# Alex Kachur - React Portfolio (COMP229)

This is my personal portfolio website, built as a project for the COMP229 Web Application Development course at Centennial College. It's a modern, responsive single-page application (SPA) created with React, Vite, and React Router.

**Live Demo:** [`https://comp229-react-portfolio-1d8e.onrender.com`](https://comp229-react-portfolio-1d8e.onrender.com)

## üöÄ Version 2.0 Upgrade Report

This version represents a complete overhaul of the initial project (v1.2), focusing on enhanced design, functionality, and code quality.

### Visual & UX Enhancements
* **Professional Design System:** Migrated from basic styling to a cohesive, modern UI using a CSS variable system for colors, spacing, and a dual-theme (light/dark) experience.
* **Responsive Navigation:** Rebuilt the navbar to be sticky, semi-transparent, and fully responsive with a hamburger menu for mobile.
* **Upgraded Layout:** Implemented a sticky footer and consistent container-based layout for a more professional look.
* **Interactive Elements:** Added a "lift on hover" effect to cards and a "reveal-on-scroll" animation to the home page hero section.

### Functional Upgrades
* **Dynamic Project Pages:** Added a dynamic route (`/projects/:id`) so each project can have a detailed view page.
* **Project Filtering:** The Projects page now includes live search and tag filtering capabilities.
* **Interactive Contact Form:** The form now includes full client-side validation and state management.

### Code Architecture & Quality
* **Refactored with Custom Hooks:** Centralized project data into a `useProjects.js` hook to decouple logic from the UI and prepare for a future API connection.
* **Component Reusability:** Broke down repeated UI elements (like the service items) into a reusable `ServiceCard.jsx` component to keep the code DRY.
* **Performance Optimization:** Implemented the `useMemo` hook to ensure the project filtering logic only runs when necessary, improving performance.
* **File Cleanup:** Removed all unused starter files and dependencies for a leaner, more professional codebase.

## ‚úÖ Future Roadmap / To-Do List

- [ ] **Content Expansion:**
    -   Flesh out the **About Me** page with more personal details or a "My Philosophy" section.
    -   Add more detailed descriptions to each **Project Details** page (e.g., "Challenges Faced," "What I Learned").
    -   Expand the **Education** section with specific noteworthy courses or achievements.

- [ ] **Visual Polish:**
    -   Add a visually appealing banner image or graphic to the **About Me** and **Services** pages.
    -   Incorporate technology logos (React, Node.js, etc.) into the **Services** section.
    -   Replace the generated placeholder images for projects with high-quality, final screenshots.

- [ ] **Project Integration:**
    -   Upload the C# Hangman and Prestige Exotics projects to their own GitHub repositories.
    -   Update the "GitHub" links on the portfolio to point to these new, live repositories.

- [ ] **Services Page Expansion:**
    -   Convert each service on the **Services** page into a link (e.g., `/services/web-development`).
    -   Create a unique details page for each service, explaining the process, tools used, and potential outcomes.

- [ ] **Contact Form Hyperlinks:**
    -   Make the email and phone number in the **Contact** page's info panel clickable using `mailto:` and `tel:` hyperlinks.

- [ ] **(Top-Notch) Connect to a Backend:**
    -   Migrate the static project data from `useProjects.js` to the Node.js/Express/MongoDB API from Week 1 of the course.
    -   Update the `useProjects.js` hook to `fetch` data from the live API.
    -   Make the Contact form submit its data to a backend endpoint.

- [ ] **(Top-Notch) Accessibility Audit:**
    -   Use a tool like the Lighthouse accessibility checker in Chrome DevTools to ensure high color contrast, proper ARIA labels, and keyboard navigability.
