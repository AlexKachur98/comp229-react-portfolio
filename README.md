# Alex Kachur - React Portfolio (COMP229)

This is my personal portfolio website, built as a project for the COMP229 Web Application Development course at Centennial College. It's a modern, responsive single-page application (SPA) created with React, Vite, and a professional, scalable project architecture.

## üöÄ Version 2.3 Upgrade
This version introduces a major refactor and polish:

### Architecture
- Adopted **folder-per-component/page** structure for scalability.  
- Migrated to **CSS Modules** for component-scoped styles.  
- Centralized project data into `projects.js` + custom hook `useProjects.js`.  

### Animation & UX
- Introduced **Framer Motion variants** for consistent animation patterns.  
- Added **search query highlighting** on Projects page.  
- Added **skeleton loaders** for smoother perceived performance.  

### Accessibility & SEO
- Added `aria-describedby` for form errors and auto-focus on first invalid field.  
- Added `aria-hidden="true"` to skeleton components.  
- Improved `index.html` with SEO-friendly `<meta>` tags and theme-color.  

### Image Optimization
This project uses a lightweight `OptimizedImage` component to improve performance:  

- **WebP first**: If a `.webp` version of an image exists, it will be served to browsers that support it.  
- **Fallback to original**: If WebP is unsupported or missing, the original `.jpg` or `.png` file is displayed.  
- All images are stored in `/public/images`, so they are served statically at build time.  

This ensures modern browsers get smaller, optimized images, while older browsers still work with the original format.
