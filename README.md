# Alex Kachur - React Portfolio (COMP229)

This is my personal portfolio website, built as a project for the COMP229 Web Application Development course at Centennial College. It's a modern, responsive single-page application (SPA) created with React, Vite, and a professional, scalable project architecture.

**Live Demo:** [`https://comp229-react-portfolio-1d8e.onrender.com`](https://comp229-react-portfolio-1d8e.onrender.com)

## üöÄ Version 2.2 Upgrade Report: Architectural Refactor

This version represents a major professional refactor of the entire frontend architecture to improve scalability, maintainability, and performance.  

### Code Architecture & Styling
* Refactored the entire project to a folder-per-component structure for improved scalability and colocation.  
* Migrated component-specific styles from a single global stylesheet to CSS Modules, preventing style collisions while maintaining a global utility stylesheet.  
* Abstracted all project data fetching into a reusable custom hook (`useProjects`).  

### Animation & Performance
* Integrated Framer Motion as the single source for all application animations.  
* Created a reusable `<AnimatedPage>` component to centralize and simplify page transition logic.  
* Implemented a skeleton loader on the Projects page to improve perceived loading performance.  
* Created an `<OptimizedImage>` component using the `<picture>` element to serve modern WebP images with fallbacks.  

### Accessibility Enhancements
* Added a top-level, screen-reader-friendly error summary to the Contact page for improved form validation feedback.  
* Implemented keyboard focus management for the mobile navigation menu.

    -   Replace the generated placeholder images for projects with high-quality, final screenshots.  

- [ ] **(Top-Notch) Full-Stack Integration:**  
    -   **Build API & Database:** Set up a Node.js/Express server, connect to MongoDB, and build a full CRUD API for projects.  
    -   **Refactor Frontend:** Update the `useProjects` hook and Contact form to communicate with the live API.  
    -   **Implement User Authentication:** Add user registration/login with JWTs and create protected frontend/backend routes.

    -   **Test & Deploy Backend:** Write tests for the API and deploy the full-stack application to a production cloud platform.  

- [ ] **(Top-Notch) Final Accessibility Audit:**  
    -   Use a tool like Lighthouse to audit for any remaining issues (e.g., color contrast, ARIA roles).  
    -   Implement focus trapping within the mobile navigation menu when it is open.
