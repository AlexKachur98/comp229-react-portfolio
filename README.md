## ‚úÖ Future Roadmap / To-Do List

- [ ] **Content Expansion:**
    -   Flesh out the **About Me** page with more personal details or a "My Philosophy" section.
    -   Add more detailed descriptions to each **Project Details** page (e.g., "Challenges Faced," "What I Learned").
    -   Expand the **Education** section with specific noteworthy courses or achievements.

- [ ] **Visual Polish:**
    -   Add a visually appealing banner image or graphic to the **About Me** and **Services** pages.
    -   Incorporate technology logos (React, Node.js, etc.) into the **Services** section.
    -   Replace the generated placeholder images for projects with high-quality, final screenshots.

- [ ] **Services Page Expansion:**
    -   Convert each service on the **Services** page into a link (e.g., `/services/web-development`).
    -   Create a unique details page for each service, explaining the process, tools used, and potential outcomes.

- [ ] **(Top-Notch) Connect to a Backend:**
    -   Migrate the static project data from `useProjects.js` to the Node.js/Express/MongoDB API from Week 1 of the course.
    -   Update the `useProjects.js` hook to `fetch` data from the live API.
    -   Make the Contact form submit its data to a backend endpoint.

- [ ] **(Top-Notch) Accessibility Audit:**
    -   Use a tool like the Lighthouse accessibility checker in Chrome DevTools to ensure high color contrast, proper ARIA labels, and keyboard navigability.
